Face Recognition based Attendance System using Machine Learning

ABSTRACT:
In the near future, face recognition-based attendance systems will be utilized in all places
instead of the traditional approach; it may even replace biometric attendance systems. The goal
of this project is to create a new attendance system based on real-time facial recognition. Face
recognition technology is also used by Facebook, which tags the names of faces when you submit
photographs that have already been tagged by you. The proposed system recognizes and encodes the unique 
traits of the faces in the database into a pattern image. Python modules are employed in our suggested 
system, and a machine learning approach called a classifier is used to discover the personâ€™s name. The steps
of the operation are image capture, facial features, face recognition, and an attendance system. This model combines
a camera that records an input image, an algorithm for detecting faces in input images, encoding and identifying the faces,
and recording attendance in a spreadsheet. The training database is built by inputting the faces of permitted pupils into 
the system. After that, the cropped photographs are saved in a database with their associated labels. The attendance is recorded using the matching face.

Attendance Updation:
After face recognition process, the recognized faces will be
marked as present in the excel sheet and the rest will be
marked as absent and the list of absentees will be mailed to
the respective faculties. Faculties will be updated with
monthly attendance sheet at the end of every month.
